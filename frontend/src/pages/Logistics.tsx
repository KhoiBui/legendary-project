                        <ul>
                            <li>If you are a Vietnamese, you can apply for a 5 year/multiple 
                                entry visa with any travel agency. The typical cost is under $100.  You can use the service of Titan Travel, Ms. Cathy Phuong Ngo office phone number is 714-531-1883, cell phone number is 714-679-4859, email sales@titantraveltax.com, address 10495 Bolsa Ave #107, Westminster, CA 92683, or any travel agency of your choice.</li>
                            <li>If you are not a Vietnamese but your spouse or parents are Vietnamese, you can also apply for this 5 years visa as long as you provide a copy of your birth certificate or marriage license.</li>
                            <li>If you already have a 5 year visa, please check to make sure the date of expiry is on or after July 30-2025</li>
                            <li>For all other non Vietnamese, you can apply for a 1 month, single entry e-visa using this link:  <a href="https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/web/guest/trang-chu-ttdt"><span style={{color:'red'}}>https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/web/guest/trang-chu-ttdt</span></a>  The cost is $25.  If you need to have multiple entries, you can apply for multiple e-visas (be sure to apply at different times).  </li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>Be sure to apply for your visa early.  When you receive your visa, remember to double check to make sure all information are correct.  If there are mistake, contact your travel agency or the consulate website for instruction. </li>
                        <li>VnHOPE won't be able to assist you with any visa related issue at all, so please work with your travel agency.</li>
                        <li>(If you are in Vietnam already and for some reason your visa is lost, please go to any travel agency right away and ask them to help you obtain a new visa.  Don't wait until you go to the airport, it will be very problematic and costly).</li>

                        <li>Our clinic days start early. We plan to have breakfast offered at our hotel and start loading the bus with supplies and equipment around 6:45 - 7:00 AM </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Note: Loading and unloading of supplies and equipment from and to our bus are expected at the beginning and end of each clinic.</li>
                            <li>In addition, we usually have to prepare for clinics the night before, with re-stocking of our pharmacy inventory.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>All teams must board our charter buses on time, which leaves promptly at 7:00 AM. Bus rides are about 1-2 hours long depending on the location of our clinics</li>
                        <li>Below is an example of our typical medical mission schedule, but may be subject to change.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><b>Patient Vollume</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The number of patients we plan to visit our clinic depends on a variety of factors including how many Health Professional volunteers and students we recruit, location of the clinic, etc.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Typically, we plan to see about 250 primary care patients, 150 pediatric patients and 100 gynecologic patients each day we have clinic</li>

                        </ul>

                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Student Rotations</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>On a rotating basis, students will be involved in taking vital signs and checking labs. Students assist with vision screening, patient education, pharmacy dispensing, and organizing patient flows.</li>
                        <li>Students will also be shadowing primary care, pediatric, gynecology, and dental services.  Student team leaders will train and guide student volunteers through all these processes.</li>
                        <li>Rotations are subject to change depending on our local volunteer partners and the Vietnamese government, remember to be open minded about last minute changes.</li>

                    <p><b>Work Attire and Things to Pack</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since weâ€™ll be working as representatives of VnHOPE, it is expected that all volunteers wear their ID badges</li>
                        <li>It will be hot and humid (our clinical will likely not have air conditioning) so plan on wearing lightweight pants or scrubs. Short shorts are not allowed and girls are not to wear shorts on work days due to cultural norms. Guys may wear knee length shorts.</li>
                        <li>Closed toe shoes are also part of the work dress code.  </li>
                        <li>For sightseeing/field trip days, you can dress casually.  </li>
                        <li>Expect sweat, mosquitoes, and allergies. Plan on packing sunscreen, mosquito repellent, hats, sunglasses, cooling towels, and masks.  </li>
                        <li>Personal medications to consider are Ibuprofen, Pepto-Bismol, Immodium, Neosporin, Hydrocortisone cream 1%, and Claritin.</li>
                        <li>Personal care items to consider are band-aids, feminine hygiene products, hand-sanitizers, baby wipes, and ear plugs (in case your roommate snores.)</li>
                        <li>Last, you might notice from the schedule above that thereâ€™s an end of mission gala planned.  Plan on packing formal outfits for the gala/party.</li>

The children absolutely love to receive them after their dental visits or as a gift at pharmacy. In addition, small stickers are a hit as treats for our young patients after a lab test or a vision screening.</li>
                        <li>To stock our pharmacy with childrenâ€™s vitamins, we ask each volunteer to donate bottles of chewable vitamins. </li>
                        <li>Lastly, our adult patients treasure our gifts of eucalyptus oil bottles and sunglasses. </li>
                        <li>Please start asking your friends and family for these donations.  We ask that you pack these donation items in a large packing box as a check-in baggage. See packing list for more details.</li>

For lunch, we will be eating at our clinic site. For dinner, each student team will have their own table for meals at our hotel. Team S is free to roam around but donâ€™t expect to eat any leftovers from the students. They are known to have meals around town even after they consume their dinner at the hotel. In addition, there will be opportunities to eat dinners out, of your choice, throughout the week. We advise that you donâ€™t partake in street foods unless you have traveled to Vietnam previously and have built up a strong GI immune system. Otherwise, proceed at your own risk.  In addition, only drink bottled water, and avoid putting ice  in your drinks.  The students will quickly figure out the popular destinations for coconut water, che and boba drinks among many other discoveries so ask them to share their finds with you.</li>
