        <SubSectionHeader title="IS THE MEDICAL MISSION SUITABLE FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS?" />
        <p>High school (HS) students are allowed to apply; however, they 
          must be accompanied by a parent/guardian. Unfortunately, there’s 
          no definite answer we can provide on suitability because each child is different. 
          When it comes to personality and maturity no 2 children are exactly alike. 
          Therefore, <b>listed below are the 
          factors that parents need to carefully consider before taking their HS child on the trip.</b></p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Factors for parents to consider before taking their HS child on the trip:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>The weather is grueling during the summer time in Vietnam. Temperature is typically in the 90°s with 80% humidity. You will sweat and feel sticky all day long.</li>
              <li>The clinic work is long and hard. A normal work day is about 9 hours long plus 2-3 hours of commute time on the bus. We work 6-8 clinics during the 2 weeks period. We will work 2 or 3 consecutive days before getting a day off.</li>
              <li>Volunteers typically get up at 5:30AM, eat breakfast around 6AM, and get on the bus at about 7AM. The group will return to the hotel for dinner around 7PM. Then we all get to repeat the cycle again the following day.</li>
              <li>Since this is a medical mission operating on a budget, the hotel accommodation is basic and the food is simple. The hotel is typically 3 stars or lower (Vietnam standard). Each student will have a roommate of similar age for the full 2 weeks.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>HS students 16 or younger don’t have the full privileges of older college students:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>They won’t be grouped together with the student team. Instead, they are part of the adult team so they can be under the supervision of their parents. This means they will ride the adult team’s bus and are only allowed to go out at night with other HS students and adults. They aren’t allowed to go out with older college students.</li>
              <li>They will be assigned a specific task at the clinics, usually gift station or counting pills in Pharmacy. They won’t rotate through all stations as the regular student team.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>We adopted these policies because young HS students in general don’t have sufficient maturity to be exposed to topics college students may consider casual (i.e., partying, drinking, alcohol, relationships). We don’t want parents complaining to us about the type of conversations that their young children may overhear.</li>
          <li>HS students 17 or older will be part of the student team with only 1 restriction:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>At night, they can’t go out with college students. They must go out with other HS students under the supervision of adults.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>We can’t predict how well your child will adapt and react to the experience. Just keep in mind that you probably don’t want to expose your child to an environment that they aren't quite socially and mentally ready for. A perceived unpleasant experience may discourage them from returning or pursuing a career in medicine.</li>
          <li>We love to have all of our student volunteers returning some time down the line, so we would like to make sure they arrive in Vietnam the first time with the proper frame of mind and realistic expectations.</li>
          <li>We find that the greatest benefits of the medical mission come when the students are in their college years trying to decide on their career path. Each summer, we average about 12-15 returning students who work their way into leadership positions.</li>

        <SubSectionHeader title="HOW DO I GO ABOUT USING A CELL PHONE IN VIETNAM?" />
          <p><b>Here are some suggested guidelines for using the Mobifone carrier:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unlock your cell phone before your departure</li>
            <li>Download Viber app on your phone and ask your significant others to do the same.  You can 
              communicate via Viber for free wherever there is WIFI, this will save you a lot of money!</li>
            <li>If both you and your family are on Facebook, you can make free calls via messenger also.</li>
            <li>When you arrive in Vietnam, we usually ask a sales person to come 
              to the hotel and sell you the tourist sims cards and a cheap Vietnam phone (if you want one)</li>
            <li>The sims card will give you a Vietnam mobile phone number, unlimited data for 30 days, 
              30 min of international call for 250,000 VND​</li>
          </ul>
          <img src = {sims} width = "450" height = "550" style={{ display:'block' , margin: 'auto' }}/>
          <ul>
            <li>Remove your US sims card and insert your Vietnam sims card in your phone</li>
            <li>Whenever you use your VN mobile phone number to talk, the money or minutes on your account 
              will go down, when it reaches the minimum level, you won’t be able to make any calls at all.</li>
            <li>You can check to see how much money you have left in your account, by dialing *101#</li>
            <li>A message will appear on your screen to let you know how much money you have left
              and the date your sims card will expire</li>
            <li>​If your phone runs out of money, you can “top up” your phone by 
              buying a so called “scratch card” which has actual “minutes” on it</li>
          </ul>
          <img src = {sims3} width = "600" height = "450" style={{ display:'block' , margin: 'auto' }}/>
          <img src = {sims5} width = "300" height = "400" style={{ display:'block' , margin: 'auto' }}/>
          <ul>
            <li>Dial *100*, the top up number in the back of the card, 
              the phone will now be reloaded with the amount of money you pay for the “scratch card”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>THAT'S IT, now you can use the cell phone service in Vietnam!</p>

        <SubSectionHeader title="WHAT VISA IS NEEDED? SHOULD I APPLY FOR ONE?" />
          <ul>
              <li>A visa is <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>mandatory</span> for entering Vietnam.</li>
              <ul>
                  <li>If you are a Vietnamese, you can apply for a 5 year/multiple 
                      entry visa with any travel agency. The typical <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>cost is under $100</span>.</li>
                  <li>If you are not a Vietnamese but your spouse or parents are Vietnamese, 
                      you can also apply for this 5-year visa as long as you provide a 
                      copy of your birth certificate or marriage license.</li>
                  <li>If you already have a 5 year visa, please check to make sure the date of 
                      expiry is on or after July 30 of the year of your mission.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <li>For all other <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>non-Vietnamese</span>, you can <span style={{ color: 'red' }}>apply for a 1 month, single entry e-visa </span> 
                  using this link:  
                  <a href="https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/web/guest/trang-chu-ttdt"> https://evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn/web/guest/trang-chu-ttdt</a>. 
                  <span style={{ color: 'red' }}> The cost is $25. </span>If you need to have multiple entries, 
                  you can apply for multiple e-visas (be sure to apply at different times).</li>
              <li>Be sure to apply for your visa early. When you receive your visa, r
                  emember to double check to make sure all information is correct. 
                  If there is a mistake, contact your travel agency or the consulate 
                  website for instructions.</li>
              <li><span style={{ color: 'red' }}>VnHOPE won't be able to assist you with any visa-related issues at all, 
              so please work with your travel agency.</span></li>
              <li>If you are in Vietnam already and for some reason your visa is lost, 
                  please go to any travel agency right away and ask them to help you obtain 
                  a new visa. Do not wait until you go to the airport, it will be 
                  very problematic and costly.</li>
          </ul>
          

        <SubSectionHeader title="WHAT IS THE CORRECT WAY TO PROVIDE PASSPORT COPIES VS HEADSHOTS FOR VISAS?" />
        <p>Please review the sample pictures below. These items are necessary for governmental processing, 
          so they MUST be precise. Thank you for taking the time to do it right!</p>

        <SubSectionHeader title="PROTECT YOUR PASSPORT" />
          <li>
          Passport that was damaged (torn or cut or missing page) or defaced 
          (with ink mark or stain) might be denied boarding by the airline or 
          denied entry by the US or Vietnam. 
          If this is the case, please apply for a replacement prior to departure. 
          </li>
          <li>Keep your passport in the hotel safe to avoid it being lost or stolen.  If you lose your passport, you must contact the US consulate to get a replacement. This is a lengthy process; you will be stuck for weeks or months in Vietnam at your own expense. </li>
          <li>Remember, without a passport, you can’t travel around Vietnam either because you need passport to travel on airplane and to check in hotel. VnHOPE might be able to request Acnos Grand Hotel to let you stay at VnHOPE group rate, but we won’t be able to help expedite your passport replacement at all.​</li>
